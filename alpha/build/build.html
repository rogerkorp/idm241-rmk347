                    When loaded into the website, the user will use a mouse to click on a button.
                </div>
                
                <div id="rules">
                    <h2>Rules</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Script listens for user click.</li>
                        <li>When click is recognized, the script changes the class of the button to one with animation rules.</li>
                        <li>The Button then shrinks down a few pixels, as if it's being pressed down</li>
                        <li>Color of the button begins to fade in.</li>
                        <li>Button then grows to be a bit larger than normal state, but then settles down to normal size – like a recoil. </li>
                        <li>Color fades out, back to the same color as the border.</li>
                        <li>After 400ms, the animation is complete and the script changes the class of the button to a non-existant one – resetting the animation.</li>
